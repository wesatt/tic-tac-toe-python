### Objective
Create a simple tic-tac-toe game in Python that can be played in the terminal against a computer opponent.

<a name="lesson-requirements"></a>
### Lesson Requirements
1. Setup and Basics
- Create a Python script file (e.g., tic_tac_toe.py).
- Define a 3x3 grid to represent the tic-tac-toe board. Use a 2D list or a single list.
- Write a function to display the board to the terminal.
2. Core Game Logic
- Write a function to allow a player to make a move.
- Write a function to allow the computer to make a move using a basic strategy.
3. Game Mechanics
- Define a function to check for a winner (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Define a function to check for a tie (all cells filled with no winner).
- Alternate turns between the player and the computer.
4. Player Input and Validation
- Use input() to get player moves.
- Ensure the program handles invalid input gracefully.
5. Enhancements (Optional)
- Allow the player to choose their symbol (X or O).
- Let the player decide if they want to go first or second.
- Add a basic AI strategy for the computer.

### Key Concepts You Will Learn
- Basic Python syntax: Variables, lists, functions, and loops.
- Input handling: Reading and validating user input.
- Logic implementation: Conditions and flow control with if statements.
- Randomization: Using the random module for computer moves.
- Code structure: Organizing functions for clarity and reusability.

### Stretch Goals (Advanced Concepts, Optional)
- Implement a smarter AI using the Minimax algorithm.
- Add colors to the terminal output using libraries like colorama.
- Create a replay option for the game.
